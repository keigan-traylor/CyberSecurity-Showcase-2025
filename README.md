# Cybersecurity Showcase Repository

This repository contains **five high-level Python projects** designed to demonstrate fundamental cybersecurity, infrastructure, and data-engineering capabilities. Each project is self-contained including an attached .README doc explaining purpose, applicable concepts, usage, and how it relates to real-world defensive practices.

Contents:
1. iam-policy-analyzer/ - Simulated AWS IAM policy analyzer (checks for obvious overly permissive policies)
2. network-threat-dashboard/ - Mock log analysis and detection of suspicious IPs and patterns
3. webapp-vuln-scanner/ - Static, simulated web-app vulnerability scanner (XSS/SQLi heuristics)
4. linux-hardening-checker/ - Config analysis checker that suggests CIS-style hardening actions (safe, simulated)
5. anomaly-ml-detector/ - Unsupervised ML anomaly detection on mock telemetry (IsolationForest)

Each project is completely safe to run locally (so no external network calls) and includes sample data. **These scripts are intentionally high-level for demonstration purposes only** Use the supplied `README.md` in each directory to run the prepared local examples.
