# Cybersecurity Showcase Repository

This repository contains **five professional-grade, mock/simulated Python projects** designed to demonstrate cybersecurity, infrastructure, and data-engineering capabilities to potential employers. Each project is self-contained with a README explaining purpose, concepts, usage, and how it maps to real-world defensive practices.

Contents:
1. iam-policy-analyzer/ - Simulated AWS IAM policy analyzer (checks for overly permissive policies)
2. network-threat-dashboard/ - Mock log analysis and detection of suspicious IPs and patterns
3. webapp-vuln-scanner/ - Static, simulated web-app vulnerability scanner (XSS/SQLi heuristics)
4. linux-hardening-checker/ - Config analysis checker that suggests CIS-style hardening actions (safe, simulated)
5. anomaly-ml-detector/ - Unsupervised ML anomaly detection on mock telemetry (IsolationForest)

Each project is safe to run locally (no external network calls), includes sample/mock data, and is optimized for demonstration purposes. Use the supplied `README.md` in each directory to run examples, and include these projects on your GitHub to showcase defensive security skills.
