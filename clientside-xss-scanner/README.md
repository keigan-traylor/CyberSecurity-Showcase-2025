**XSS-73THv6 “Phoenix-Optimized” — Advanced Client-Side Vulnerability Scanner**

**Overview**
**XSS-73THv6 “Phoenix-Optimized”** is a research-grade, client-side XSS detection simulation implemented in vanilla JavaScript. It is designed to demonstrate advanced browser-based security automation, payload intelligence, and DOM targeting techniques while remaining non-destructive and safe for local demonstration and code-review use.

**Important — Safety & Ethics:** This repository contains simulated scanning logic for education and demonstration **ONLY**. It does not perform real exploitation, network scanning, or unauthorized testing. Use **only** on pages and systems you control or have **explicit permission** to test.

**Key Technical Highlights**

**Adaptive Payload Intelligence** — a context-aware ranking engine that prioritizes simulated payloads by historical effectiveness.

**Optimized Multi-phase Architecture** — structured, asynchronous phases (direct injection simulation, attribute testing simulation, URL reflection simulation) with strict timeouts and abort control.

**Advanced DOM Targeting** — heuristic element selection that prioritizes high-value surfaces (contenteditable, framework bindings, input fields) and uses visibility/sampling to scale across large DOMs.

**Stealth & Performance Controls** — randomized throttling, batch processing, and consolidated delays to model real-world tester behavior while maintaining low impact.

**Safe Abort & Timeout Controls** — AbortController-style handling and per-phase timeouts to guarantee predictable, reversible operation.
